# Project 2: Shiny App Development

## Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

This application utilizes two datasets, but one of them is too large to upload, please refer to the following links:
