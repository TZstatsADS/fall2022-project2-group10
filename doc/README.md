# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  


After data cleaning, the database is too large, the loading time is too long, and the time series plot and pie charts only need to use the aggregated data. Therefore, I organize the data and summary in advance, and save the summary results (just timeseries.csv and piechart csv). Users can directly use the summary results in the app to avoid the freezes caused by the long data summary time.
